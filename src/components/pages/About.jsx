       Welcome to my Portfolio! This site is React built and contains several of the recent projects I have worked on. I began coding under Columbia University's coding bootcamp, and have since become familiar with several coding languages. During the bootcamp, I created and collaborated on many succesful group projects and am currently working on a new one now! I have a passion for languages and set a goal to master the development languages as well. I believe myy affinity for translation has contributed to my success in the bootcamp, and I can't wait to learn more! If you would like to collaborate, or just chat with me, please navigate to my Contact page!
